# blueprint-webapp
This project includes a collection of [blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com) components for you to use, and for us to showcase the capabilities of Wix Component Studio.

Use this example to get a feel for how easy and fun it is to create and edit components in WCS that are based on 3rd party component libraries.

## Getting Started
Install the latest version of the WCS desktop application to get started. Refer [here](https://component-studio.wixanswers.com/en/article/kb32828) for prerequisites and setup instructions.

After installing the desktop application, have a look at [Cloning Projects](https://component-studio.wixanswers.com/en/article/kb37629) to see how to clone a project from WCS. Use this URL for the repo to clone: **`https://github.com/studio-templates/blueprint-webapp/`**

Once youâ€™ve cloned the project, just run the installation script when prompted.  
(see [Running Project Scripts](https://component-studio.wixanswers.com/en/article/kb37621]), and the project will be ready for you to use after you restart WCS.
